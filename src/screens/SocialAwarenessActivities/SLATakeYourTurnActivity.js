          Learning to share is an important, yet occasionally difficult skill for preschoolers.
          This can be practiced with all activities that require turn-taking from baking cookies
          and taking turns stirring to drawing and taking turns using colored pencils.

          A particular activity known to build this skill involves taking turns making an animal sound. 
          The listener has to repeat the sound and guess the animal, then itâ€™s their turn to make a sound.
